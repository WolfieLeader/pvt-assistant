- In all interaction, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Code

- Security is number 1 priority!
- Clean, readable, intuitive, consistent, and simple code
- Use meaningful, descriptive names
- Use best practices, conventions, and principles
- Good error handling and edge case handling for bug-free code
- Performance and optimization
- Minimal comments — only for complex logic that isn't self-evident
- casing: file - kebab, code - camel, SQL schema - snake

## Dependencies

- Using Expo React Native
- Using Uniwind and not Nativewind for Tailwind support
- Using latest Zod (v4), convention for schema is `zXx`
- Using Drizzle with SQLite and Expo

## Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
