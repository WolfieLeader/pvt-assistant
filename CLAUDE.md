# pvt-assistant — Bun Expo React Native app

- Be extremely concise, sacrifice grammar for concision
- End plans with unresolved questions list (concise)
- Security first, minimal comments, file: kebab, code: camel, SQL: snake
- When adding/removing deps, update `docs/dependencies.md`
- Uniwind (not Nativewind), Zod v4 (`zXx` schema convention), Drizzle + SQLite + Expo
- Feature flow: brainstorming → writing-plans → executing-plans → verification → retro
- Skip planning for single-file fixes / UI tweaks
