# pvt-assistant — Bun Expo React Native app

- In all interaction, be extremely concise, sacrifice grammar for concision
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any
- Security first!
- Minimal comments, only if needed
- When adding/removing deps, update `docs/dependencies.md`
- CSS tokens in `global.css` must have matching `src/consts/`
- RN fonts: use per-weight family names, not `fontWeight`
